```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>

// Derived exception class
class CustomException : public std::runtime_error {
public:
    CustomException(const std::string &msg) : std::runtime_error(msg) {}
};

// Function that throws an exception
void throw_exception() {
    throw CustomException("An error occurred.");
}

int main() {
    try {
        std::cout << "Before throwing an exception\n";
        throw_exception();
        std::cout << "This line will not be executed\n";
    } catch (const std::exception &e) {
        std::cerr << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    std::cout << "After handling the exception\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a derived exception class `CustomException` which inherits from the standard library's `runtime_error`, overriding its constructor to use a user-provided message. The `throw_exception` function throws an instance of `CustomException` when called. In the `main` function, we first print a message, then call `throw_exception`. If an exception is thrown, it gets caught in the `catch` block and its message is printed to the stderr. Finally, we print another message to indicate that the exception has been handled.

You can expand this code snippet by adding more functions as needed, each potentially throwing custom exceptions, and expanding the `try-catch` block to handle them appropriately.

In C++, exception handling is a mechanism for dealing with unexpected events during program execution. It allows you to write code that can recover gracefully from such events, instead of crashing. The provided C++ code uses exception handling to demonstrate a derived exception class, a function that throws an exception, and a `try-catch` block to handle the exception.

The code first includes the necessary headers for C++ standard library, `iostream` for input/output streams, `stdexcept` for the standard exceptions, and `string` for strings.

Then, it defines a derived exception class named `CustomException` which is derived from `std::runtime_error`. This derived exception class overrides its constructor to use a user-provided message. By doing this, you can create your custom exceptions with specific error messages, making it easier to understand and debug the code when an exception is thrown.

Next, it defines a function named `throw_exception()` that throws an instance of `CustomException` when called. The function does not have a return type, and its purpose is to generate an exception for the `try-catch` block to handle.

In the `main()` function, we first print a message, then call `throw_exception`. If an exception is thrown, it gets caught in the `catch` block and its message is printed to the stderr. This prevents the program from crashing awkwardly and allows you to handle the exception logically, such as by retrying the operation or terminating the program gracefully. After successfully handling the exception, we print another message to indicate that the program continues execution.

Overall, using exceptions is an important feature in C++ code since it enables the program to continue executing gracefully even when unexpected events (e.g., memory errors, input errors, I/O errors, etc.) happen. This is especially crucial in production-level applications where unexpected stopping can cause data loss, upset users, or potentially impact other programs. The code provided here serves as a stepping stone to create more comprehensive and resilient code by using derived exception classes and proper exception handling.

Absolutely, I can provide a more detailed explanation of the concepts used in this code:

1. **Exception Handling**: Exception handling is a mechanism in C++ that allows for the program to deal with and recover from runtime errors in a controlled manner. Instead of the program crashing or producing unexpected output, it can catch the exception, perform some cleanup or recovery actions, and then continue execution.

2. **try-catch Block**: The `try` and `catch` keywords form a block in which you can place potentially error-prone code. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, the program will jump out of the block and to the first `catch` block that can handle the type of the exception. The exception is passed to the `catch` block as an argument.

3. **Derived Exception Class**: In this example, we have derived a new exception class `CustomException` from the standard library's `runtime_error` class. By doing this, we can use the derived class to signal custom errors, while still benefiting from the functionality provided by the base class.

4. `CustomException(const std::string &msg)`: This is the constructor for the `CustomException` class. It takes a `string` argument `msg` and initializes the `runtime_error` base class with it. When an instance of the `CustomException` is thrown, the String passed to the constructor will be its message when caught.

5. **throw Statement**: The `throw` statement is used to trigger the propagation of an exception from the point where it is thrown to the nearest enclosing try block where a handler can catch and process it. In the example, the `throw_exception()` function throws an instance of our custom exception.

6. **std::exception**: This is the base class of all exceptions in the standard library. In the catch block, capturing an exception by reference (`const std::exception &e`) will automatically downcast the exception to any of its derived classes like `runtime_error` or `custom_exception`.

This is a basic example and it can be expanded by adding more functions that can throw different exceptions and handling them in appropriate `catch` blocks. Also, you can implement multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of errors in case your exceptions inherit from a common base class.

Given the provided C++ code, here are some common beginner mistakes that you might want to avoid:

1. **Not using try-catch blocks**: C++ exceptions are required to be caught. If the exception is not caught within the current scope, the program will terminate.

2. **Not specifying the exception type in the catch block**: The exception type must be specified in the catch block. If the exception type is not specified or does not match, the code will compile but will not catch the exception.

3. **Not re-throwing an exception**: If you can't handle the exception, it's best to let it propagate up the call stack by re-throwing it using the `throw;` statement.

4. **Not handling the base exception**: If you're catching a derived exception, you should also handle the base exception to ensure that it's caught somewhere in your code.

5. **Not providing meaningful error messages**: The error messages should clearly describe the error that occurred. In the provided code, the error message "An error occurred." might not be enough information for a real-world application.

6. **Not using exception constructions properly**: When constructing an exception object, be sure that the constructor calls `what()` to set the error message. If you don't, you'll end up with an empty error message.

Here's an example of how some of these issues could be addressed:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>

// Derived exception class
class CustomException : public std::runtime_error {
public:
    CustomException(const std::string &msg)
        : std::runtime_error(msg) {
        // Set the error message
        what();
    }
};

// Alternative way to throw an exception
void throw_exception() {
    std::string error_msg("An error occurred.");
    throw CustomException(error_msg);
}

void function_that_thinks_it_might_throw() {
    // Perform some operation that might throw an exception
    // If it doesn't throw, nothing happens
}

// Handle derived and base exceptions
void handle_exception() {
    try {
        throw_exception();
    } catch (const CustomException &e) {
        // Handle CustomException
        std::cerr << "Caught CustomException: " << e.what() << "\n";
    } catch (const std::exception &e) {
        // Handle base exception
        std::cerr << "Caught base exception: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
        std::cout << "Before possibly throwing an exception\n";
        handle_exception();
        std::cout << "After handling the exception, assume everything is fine\n";
    } catch (const std::exception &e) {
        std::cerr << "Unexpected exception: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this revised version, the `throw_exception` function constructs the `CustomException` object with an error message. The `function_that_thinks_it_might_throw` performs an operation that might throw an exception, but simply does nothing if no exception is thrown. The `handle_exception` function is now able to handle both the derived `CustomException` and its base `runtime_error` at the same time. In `main`, instead of re-throwing the exception, an alternative message is printed to indicate that the program should continue as if the exception was handled correctly.
