```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Abstract base class
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double getArea() const = 0;
    virtual std::string getType() const = 0;
    // Pure virtual functions must be declared in the base class
};

// Derived class for circles
class Circle : public Shape {
private:
    double radius;

public:
    Circle(double radius) : radius(radius) {}

    double getArea() const override {
        return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }

    std::string getType() const override {
        return "Circle";
    }
};

// Derived class for squares
class Square : public Shape {
private:
    double side;

public:
    Square(double side) : side(side) {}

    double getArea() const override {
        return side * side;
    }

    std::string getType() const override {
        return "Square";
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape *shapes[2];

    Circle circle(5);
    Square square(4);

    shapes[0] = &circle;
    shapes[1] = &square;

    for(int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        std::cout << shapes[i]->getType() << " area: " << shapes[i]->getArea() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This example consists of an abstract base class `Shape` and two derived classes: `Circle` and `Square`. Both `Circle` and `Square` are derived from the abstract base class `Shape` and provide their implementations for `getArea()` and `getType()`. In the main function, a simple loop iterates through the array of shapes, retrieves their type and area, and prints them out.

This C++ code matters because it demonstrates the concept of abstraction, which is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming. Abstraction allows programmers to define the essential features of an object without including background details or implementation.

In this example, the `Shape` class is an abstract base class, meaning it cannot be instantiated directly. It has two pure virtual functions: `getArea()` and `getType()`. Pure virtual functions are function declarations with no definition in the base class and must be provided by derived classes. By declaring these functions as pure virtual, the `Shape` class becomes an abstract base class, which requires that any class derived from it must provide an implementation for the pure virtual functions.

The `Circle` and `Square` classes are derived from the `Shape` class and provide their respective implementations for `getArea()` and `getType()`. This allows the `Shape` class to represent any shape with an area and a type, without specifying the specific details of each shape.

In the main function, an array of pointers to `Shape` objects is created, and then two objects of `Circle` and `Square` class are created and added to the array. This demonstrates the powerful polymorphic behavior of C++, allowing the code to treat both `Circle` and `Square` objects as `Shape` objects, and maintain the abstraction.

Finally, the code iterates through the array, calling the `getType()` and `getArea()` functions on each object and printing the results. This allows the code to work with different shapes without being hard-coded for each specific shape, increasing code flexibility and maintainability.

Overall, this code snippet provides a simple yet powerful demonstration of the concept of abstraction in C++ programming. It highlights the benefits of defining an abstract base class and testing its behavior with derived classes in a polymorphic context, promoting code reusability, maintainability and extendability.

The provided C++ code demonstrates the concept of Abstraction through the use of an abstract base class and its derived classes.

1. Abstract Base Class (`Shape`): This is a base class from which other classes can inherit. It has at least one pure virtual function, which means that this function does not provide an implementation, but it is required to be overridden by any derived classes. In this case, the `Shape` class has two pure virtual functions: `getArea()` and `getType()`. They are declared with a `= 0` suffix. The purpose of having a pure virtual function in a base class is to define the interface that all derived classes must implement.

2. Derived Classes (`Circle` and `Square`): These are classes that inherit from the abstract base class `Shape`. They provide their own implementations for the pure virtual functions in the base class. In this case, both `Circle` and `Square` classes provide an implementation for the `getArea()` and `getType()` functions.

3. Polymorphism: The main function in this example demonstrates polymorphism. It declares an array `shapes` of pointers to the abstract base class `Shape`. It then creates instances of the derived classes `Circle` and `Square`, and stores their addresses in this array. The loop in the main function reaches both derived classes through the base pointer, demonstrating that the derived classes share the same interface defined by the base class.

The strength of abstraction in this code is that it allows us to work with objects of derived classes through a pointer or reference to the base class. This improves code readability, maintainability, and allows for easier extension of the initial class hierarchy.

Several common beginner mistakes can be found in the provided C++ code. Here are some of them:

1. **Missing include directives**: You have included `<iostream>`, but there are some other standard library headers that might be needed, such as `<vector>` or `<string>`, depending on the extensions of the code.

2. **Uninitialized variables**: There are no initializations for the `Shapes` array in the `main` function, which could lead to undefined behavior. Initialize it with `nullptr` or create the objects first before assigning them to the array.

3. **Pointers vs. references**: In the `main` function, using pointers is a reasonable choice as you are storing the addresses of the objects. However, using references instead of pointers might be preferable in this case, as you are not planning to modify the objects themselves. This would simplify the code and reduce the use of `dynamic_cast` in the `for` loop.

4. **Dynamic casting in loops**: In the loop, you are using `dynamic_cast` to ensure you are working with the correct derived class type. Although this works due to polymorphism, it might not be necessary if references are used instead of pointers.

5. **Consider using a container**: Instead of a raw array for storing shapes, consider using a container and potentially implementing a more polymorphic container interface that allows for easier management and manipulation of shape objects.

6. ** avoiding magnetic variables**: In the `Circle` and `Square` constructors, consider initializing the class's private data members (`radius` for `Circle` and `side` for `Square`) within them to avoid magnetic variables, a common pitfall for novice programmers.

To improve the code, you can adopt the above recommendations and refactoring, making the code safer, more efficient, and easier to maintain.
